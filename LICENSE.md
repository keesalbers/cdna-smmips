The code to compute MIP performance scores included in the script [design_mips_for_all_transcripts.py](src/python/design_mips_for_all_transcripts.py) 
is based on the MIPGEN 2.0 package to design MIPS for DNA, by Boyle et al, [Bioinformatics, 18(30):2670-2, 2014](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24867941). 
The copyright is held by Evan Boyle. 
Commercial use of any designs or analyses making use of the MIP performance scores is not allowed.
